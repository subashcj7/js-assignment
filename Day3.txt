1)The various methods of console in javascript are
->console.log()=It prints the statement in the debug console(directly browser)
->console.error()=It displays the error message in the console window
->console.warn()=It shows the warning message in the console window
->console.clear()=It will clear all the statements whix=ch was previously shown
->console.timeEnd()=It will display the content for specific time and shows how much time it takes to complete
->console.table()=The content which we entered is displays in the form of table as rows and columns
>console.count()=It will execute the statement until which we specified in the range




2)D/W var,let and const
->Var=The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable
var val=12;
eg:-
  var a =10;
  console.log(a); 
  if(true){
   var a=20;
   console.log(a);
  }

->Let=The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.

let val=10;
eg:-
  let a =10;
  console.log(a);  
  if(true){
   let a=20;
   console.log(a); 
  }
  

  ->const=const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.

  const a=10;

  eg:- const VAL =10;
  console.log(VAL);


  3)Datatypes in javascript:-
  ->String	=represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
  ->Number=	represents numeric values e.g. 100
  ->Boolean=	represents boolean value either false or true
  ->Undefined	=represents undefined value
  ->Null=	represents null i.e. no value at all
  ->Object=	represents instance through which we can access members
  ->Array=represents group of similar values
  ->RegExp=represents regular expression
